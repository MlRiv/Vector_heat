# Toy Implementation of the Vector Heat Method for MVA Course "Minimal Path and Deformable Objects"

This Jupyter notebook provides a simple implementation of the Vector Heat Method (VHM) as described in the paper by Keenan Crane, Nicholas Sharp, and Yousuf Soliman. The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the basic concepts of the VHM for the Minimal Path and Deformable Objects course at MVA. The theoretical background is covered in the accompanying report; therefore, this notebook focuses on the practical implementation.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pytorch
- Torchvision
- Kornia (optional)

## Code Sources

The code for the Vector Heat Method implementation is adapted from the following sources (additional repositories have been used, and are referenced in the notebook):
- [Link to Nicholas Sharp's academic page](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/VectorHeatMethod/index.html) for a nice demo.
- [Link to Keenan Crane's GitHub repository](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/VectorHeatMethod/index.html) for additional background on heat diffusion methods.
