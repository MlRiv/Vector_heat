# Toy implementation of the Vector Heat Method for MVA course Minimal Path and Deformable objects
Some toy implementation of The Vector Heat Method as described in the paper of K.Crane, N.Sharp and Y.Soliman. All the implementations have been gathered in one jupyter notebook. Consequently, the different sources for the code are given in Markdown.
Note that the theoretical results are available in the report.
